        <h2>✅ ToDo App (JavaScript)</h2>
        <p>
          A simple yet functional ToDo app built using vanilla JavaScript. It
          allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. This project
          helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and
          localStorage.

        <h2>🎬 Netflix Clone</h2>
        <p>
          As part of a university project, I built a basic Netflix clone that
          simulates the UI and browsing experience of Netflix. This helped me
          learn about layouts, media components, and responsive design.

        <h2>📄 Research Paper: The Effects of Diabetes on Eyesight</h2>
        <p>
          I authored a research paper focused on how diabetes can affect human
          eyesight. The paper explores the medical and technical aspects of
          diabetic retinopathy and its detection. It was a valuable experience
          in combining research with technology and health awareness.
